<h1>My short story</h1>
<br />

This story begins with a piano player. The piano player got a gig at a local resturant. He was nervous about the job, but everyone told him he would be fine. Once he got there, he began to play. He fumbled at first due to his nerves, but eventually, he played like a professional. He was thanked for his playing and was given many tips. He continued to play everyday.
